## Context ðŸ¤”
Working on a Business Intelligence area i have to analyze data every day and the most frecuently tasks that i do are: review each variable to know the distribution of the data using some basic statistical metrics and ploting a histogram and boxplot to see if the data hacve some outliers.

## Solution ðŸ’¡
I decided to try my first attempt to create a package that automatize those litle tasks, so today (Apr-10-2020) i decided to create and publish this package with a function that do those tasks.
